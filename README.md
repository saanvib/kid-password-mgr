There is an increase in the number of cyber attacks in the world, many of them made possible due to the use of weak passwords or overly reused passwords. If people use the same passwords on multiple websites, if a hacker knows one password, then they can log in to all of those websites, thus increasing the risk and exposure. With so many password managers available in the market today, such attacks should not continue to happen. 

People who don't use password managers write their passwords down, either in an unencrypted computer file, a note-taking app, or on a physical notepad. Many people also have security concerns about password managers themselves. However, the biggest fear people have against password managers was that they would forget their master password. This causes them to keep their master password in email and/or notepad, which is just as unsafe as keeping a list of passwords. People who used browser-based password managers loved the convenience of the autofill feature. 

This easy-to-use chrome extension using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, was made for kids and seniors for storing and managing passwords. The password manager uses a master password for logging in and securing the list of passwords. The key innovation is to use 3 different images and a number to generate the master password so that the users do not have to remember an actual password.
